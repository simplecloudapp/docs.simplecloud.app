## Why a Modern CLI?

SimpleCloud v3 marks a significant shift from the traditional Manager Console to a modern CLI approach. This change brings several key advantages:

- **Remote Management**: The CLI can be installed and run from anywhere, allowing you to manage your cloud system from your local machine while the cloud runs on remote servers.
- **Interactive Experience**: The CLI provides an interactive experience that guides you through complex operations:
  - Step-by-step group creation wizards
  - Smart autocompletion for commands and parameters
  - Real-time validation of inputs
- **Automation Capabilities**: Command line interfaces excel at automation:
  - Easy integration with scripts and tools
  - Support for continuous integration workflows
  - Batch operations for repetitive tasks

<Note>
    While the v2 Manager Console served its purpose well, the CLI represents a more flexible and powerful approach to cloud management that better serves modern server administration needs.

## Command Structure

The SimpleCloud CLI has been updated with new commands and structures to enhance functionality and usability.

## Connect Command

The `connect` command connects to the controller via a specified connection or creates a new one.

```bash
simplecloud connect [flags]
```

## Connection Command

The `connection` command shows the current connection.

```bash
simplecloud connection
```

## Create Command

The `create` command is used to create new resources in your cloud system.

## Create Group

Create a new server group with specified configuration.

```bash
simplecloud create group [flags]
```

**Flags**
- `--configurator string`: Server configurator
- `--max-memory string`: Maximum memory allocation for each server
- `--max-online string`: Maximum number of servers that can be online
- `--max-players string`: Maximum players per server
- `--min-memory string`: Minimum memory allocation for each server
- `--min-online string`: Minimum number of servers that must be online
- `--name string`: Group name
- `--port string`: Starting port number for servers
- `--server-url string`: Server software download URL (optional)
- `--software string`: Server software type
- `--template string`: Template type (`dynamic` or `static`)
- `--type string`: Server type (`PROXY` or `SERVER`)
- `--minecraft-version string`: Minecraft version
- `--software-version string`: Server Software version

When all flags are set (except `--server-url`), the interactive setup wizard will be skipped. This is particularly useful for automated group creation or when you want to bypass the step-by-step configuration process.
The server url will be automatically set to the default url for the selected software and software version.
