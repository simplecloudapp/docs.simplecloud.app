## System Requirements

Before installing SimpleCloud, ensure that the following programs are installed on your system:

- **Java 21**: Required to run Minecraft servers and other Java-based components.
- **Screen**: Allows you to run processes in the background on Linux.
- **lsof**: Used for checking open files and network connections (Already installed on most Linux distributions).

## Installation

### Install the CLI

SimpleCloud now offers an extensive [CLI](/manual/cli) that covers everything you need to manage SimpleCloud. It's a small application that serves as an interface for sending commands to your SimpleCloud instance and is the easiest way to get started with SimpleCloud.

<Tabs items={['Unix', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSimpleCloud/SimpleCloud/main/install.sh)"
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  
    ```powershell
    # Create a install.bat file and paste the content of the following website into it:
    # https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSimpleCloud/simplecloud-manifest/HEAD/install.bat
    # Now you can run the install.bat file
    install.bat
    ```

    <Callout type="warning">
      This is highly experimental and not recommended.
    </Callout>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Install SimpleCloud

After installing the CLI, you can install SimpleCloud by running the following command:

```bash
simplecloud install
```

<Callout>
  If you already have a running SimpleCloud instance and want to add another
  Root Server, consider using the [Server Host
  Droplet](/manual/droplet/serverhost).
</Callout>

### Start the Controller

Start the controller by running the following command:

```bash
simplecloud start
```

<Callout>
  You can only start the controller locally. Remote access via the CLI is only
  possible once the controller is running.
</Callout>

### Create a Proxy Group

Create a proxy group by running the following command:

```bash
simplecloud group create proxy proxy
```

### Create a Lobby Group

Create a lobby group by running the following command:

```bash
simplecloud group create static lobby
```

### Configure Server Connection

Configure the server connection by creating a file called `config.yml` in the `templates/<proxy_group>/plugins/simplecloud-connection` directory of your proxy server with the following content:

```yaml
connections:
  - name: "lobby" # Name of this connection target
    permission: "" # No permission required
    server-name-matcher:
      operation: "STARTS_WITH"
      value: "lobby" # The name of your server group
```

### Configure Join Connections

Configure the join connections by adding the following to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
join-connections:
  enabled: true
  no-target-connections-found-message: "Couldn't connect you to the network because no target servers are available."
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby" # The name of the connection target you configured above
      priority: 0
```

### Configure Fallback Connections

Configure the fallback connections by adding the following to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
fallback-connections:
  enabled: true
  no-target-connections-found-message: "You have been disconnected from the network since you have been kicked and no fallback server are available."
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby" # The name of the connection target you configured above
      priority: 0
```

### Configure Commands

Configure the commands by adding the following to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: "lobby" # The name of the command
    aliases:
      - "l"
      - "hub"
      - "quit"
      - "leave"
    target-connections:
      - name: "lobby" # The name of the above configured connection target
        priority: 0
    already-connected-message: "Â§cYou are already connected to the lobby!"
    no-target-connections-found-message: "There are no lobby servers available at the moment."
    permission: "" # No permission required
```
