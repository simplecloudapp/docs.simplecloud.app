# Templates

Templates in SimpleCloud v3 provide a powerful and flexible way to manage server configurations. Unlike v2's fixed directory structure, templates now use an action-based system that allows for dynamic file management and advanced templating features.

## Understanding Templates

Templates consist of actions that are executed on certain triggers. Each action stands for a sorted list of references to other [actions](#actions) and [standard behaviours](#action-types), which are configurable with settings.

## Template Triggers

Actions can be specified under each template trigger. These will then be executed in order.

| ID      | Context                                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `start` | Will be executed when a new server is created |
| `stop`  | Will be executed when a server is stopped     |

## Template Structure

Templates are defined in YAML files located in `/droplets/serverhost-droplet/templates/definitions` or its subdirectories. The template id of a YAML file is the name of the file (without extension). Each template defines which actions should be executed on what trigger:

```yaml
when:
  start:
    - default/setup # references the default/setup action
    - ...
  stop:
    - default/delete # references the default/delete action
    - ...
```

## Context

Each template trigger will create its own context and run in it. This means that actions can also influence each other.

---

# Actions

Actions are reusable components for doing something (e.g. copy files from template folder to server).
You can reference actions in other actions and in templates. This allows for creating a reusable toolchain, keeping config files minimal and extension of existing configs easy.
All actions are located in `/droplets/serverhost-droplet/templates/actions` or its subdirectories. All actions support placeholder matching like `%my-placeholder%`.

## Action referencing

Actions can be referenced in other actions or in templates. An actions ref name consists of the YAML file name it is located in and the name of the action. For example, an action in `utils.yml` called `init-placeholders` will have the ref `utils/init-placeholders`.

## Config structure

An action in config files contains of a sorted list of action objects and references.

### Action objects

Action objects consist of the `type` field, which will set the action type executed, and [data](#action-data) that action requires.

```yaml
cache-pull-libs:
  - from: "%libs-dir%"
    to: "%server-dir%/libraries"
    type: "copy"
```

### References

A reference to another action can be made by setting ref to a action reference.

```yaml
my-action:
  - ref: other/my-other-action
```

### Mixed example

<Tabs items={["actions/utils.yml", "actions/default.yml"]}>
<Tab value="actions/utils.yml">
```yaml
cache-pull:
  - from: "%templates%/cache/%group%"
    to: "%server-dir%"
    type: "copy"
  - ref: cache-pull-libs

cache-pull-libs:

- from: "%libs-dir%"
  to: "%server-dir%/libraries"
  type: "copy"

cache-push:

- ref: cache-push-paper
- ref: cache-push-spigot

cache-push-paper:

- from: "%server-dir%/plugins/.paper-remapped/"
  to: "%templates%/cache/%group%/plugins/.paper-remapped"
  type: "copy"

cache-push-spigot:

- from: "%server-dir%/libraries"
  to: "%templates%/cache/%group%/libraries"
  type: "copy"
- from: "%server-dir%/versions"
  to: "%templates%/cache/%group%/versions"
  type: "copy"

</Tab>
<Tab value="actions/default.yml">
```yaml
static-setup:
  - ref: util/init-placeholders
  - ref: util/static-dir
  - ref: default/setup

setup:
  - ref: util/init-placeholders
  - ref: cache/cache-pull
  - ref: util/every-with-software
  - ref: util/copy
  - ref: util/configurate

delete:
  - ref: util/init-placeholders
  - ref: cache/cache-push
  - path: "%server-dir%"
    type: "delete"
````

<Callout>
  An actions ref name consists of the YAML file name it is located in and the
  name of the action. For example, an action in `utils.yml` called
  `init-placeholders` will have the ref `utils/init-placeholders`.
</Callout>

## Placeholders

Actions support dynamic placeholders, these can also be altered by the `placeholder` action:

| Variable              | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `%server-dir%`        | Directory the server will run in                                   |
| `%libs-dir%`          | Directory the (cloud) libraries are located in                     |
| `%templates%`         | Directory the actual templates folders (like in v2) are located in |
| `%forwarding-secret%` | The velocity forwarding secret                                     |

## Best Practices

1. **Template Organization**

- Use clear template naming
- Leverage referencing to keep files minimal and clean
- Document actions and references

2. **Path Management**

- Use relative paths when possible
- Leverage path variables for flexibility
- Keep consistent directory structure
