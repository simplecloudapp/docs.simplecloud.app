## Overview

In order to make the proxy redirect players to the correct server, you need to configure our [Server Connection Plugin](/manual/plugins/server-connection). This plugin is included by default with SimpleCloud.

## Configure Server Connection

Configure the server connection by creating a file called `config.yml` in the `templates/<proxy_group>/plugins/simplecloud-connection` directory of your proxy server with the following content:

```yaml
connections:
  - name: "lobby" # Name of this connection target
    permission: "" # No permission required
    server-name-matcher:
      operation: "STARTS_WITH"
      value: "lobby" # The name of your server group
```

## Configure Join Connections

Configure the join connections by adding the following to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
join-connections:
  enabled: true
  no-target-connections-found-message: "Couldn't connect you to the network because no target servers are available."
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby" # The name of the connection target you configured above
      priority: 0
```

## Configure Fallback Connections

Configure the fallback connections by adding the following to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
fallback-connections:
  enabled: true
  no-target-connections-found-message: "You have been disconnected from the network since you have been kicked and no fallback server are available."
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby" # The name of the connection target you configured above
      priority: 0
```

## Configure Commands

Configure the commands by adding the following to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: "lobby" # The name of the command
    aliases:
      - "l"
      - "hub"
      - "quit"
      - "leave"
    target-connections:
      - name: "lobby" # The name of the above configured connection target
        priority: 0
    already-connected-message: "Â§cYou are already connected to the lobby!"
    no-target-connections-found-message: "There are no lobby servers available at the moment."
    permission: "" # No permission required
```
